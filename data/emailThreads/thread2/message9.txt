Hi Mike,

Thanks for sending these over. I've reviewed both documents and everything looks mostly good, but I have one question about the contract.

It mentions that we must provide a dedicated sound engineer for DJ Horizon's set. 
We have one festival sound engineer who handles all main stage performances. 
Would this be sufficient?

Apart from this, everything else is fine. I'll process the payment once we clarify this point.

Best regards,
Stacey Summer
