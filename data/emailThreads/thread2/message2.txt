Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is â‚¬2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,
