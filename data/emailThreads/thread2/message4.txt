Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Best,
