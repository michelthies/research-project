Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your quick response. 

The €2,500 fee is a bit much for us, but we can potentially make it work. For the 90-minute set, we could do 00:30-02:00 if that works.
Regarding accommodation, we can provide two hotel rooms at the Moxy Berlin. For travel, would €500 cover the costs, or do you have specific requirements?
Also, could you share technical rider details so our production team can review them?

Looking forward to making this work!

Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Best,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for sending these over. I've reviewed both documents and everything looks mostly good, but I have one question about the contract.

It mentions that we must provide a dedicated sound engineer for DJ Horizon's set. 
We have one festival sound engineer who handles all main stage performances. 
Would this be sufficient?

Apart from this, everything else is fine. I'll process the payment once we clarify this point.

Perfect, thank you.

I've attached the signed contract and proof of payment.
Also, is DJ Horizon available for a short (15-min) press interview via Zoom during the week before the festival? 
This would be part of our promotional activities.

Best regards,
