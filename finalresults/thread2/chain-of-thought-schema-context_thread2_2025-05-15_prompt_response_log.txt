Date: September 20, 2025
Location: Tempelhofer Feld, Berlin
Capacity: 3500
Stage time request: 22:30-00:30
Budget: €1,500

We've heard great things about DJ Horizon's recent sets and believe they would be a perfect fit for our crowd.

Looking forward to your response!

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your quick response. 

The €2,500 fee is a bit much for us, but we can potentially make it work. For the 90-minute set, we could do 00:30-02:00 if that works.
Regarding accommodation, we can provide two hotel rooms at the Moxy Berlin. For travel, would €500 cover the costs, or do you have specific requirements?
Also, could you share technical rider details so our production team can review them?

Looking forward to making this work!

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Hello Mike,

My name is Stacey Summer from Vibrancy Events.
We are organizing the Equinox Festival in Berlin and would like to book DJ Horizon for the main stage.

Here are the details:
Festival name: Equinox
Date: September 20, 2025
Location: Tempelhofer Feld, Berlin
Capacity: 3500
Stage time request: 22:30-00:30
Budget: €1,500

We've heard great things about DJ Horizon's recent sets and believe they would be a perfect fit for our crowd.

Looking forward to your response!

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your quick response. 

The €2,500 fee is a bit much for us, but we can potentially make it work. For the 90-minute set, we could do 00:30-02:00 if that works.
Regarding accommodation, we can provide two hotel rooms at the Moxy Berlin. For travel, would €500 cover the costs, or do you have specific requirements?
Also, could you share technical rider details so our production team can review them?

Looking forward to making this work!

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Best,

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Location: Tempelhofer Feld, Berlin
Capacity: 3500
Stage time request: 22:30-00:30

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your quick response. 

The €2,500 fee is a bit much for us, but we can potentially make it work. For the 90-minute set, we could do 00:30-02:00 if that works.
Regarding accommodation, we can provide two hotel rooms at the Moxy Berlin. For travel, would €500 cover the costs, or do you have specific requirements?
Also, could you share technical rider details so our production team can review them?

Looking forward to making this work!

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Best,

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your quick response. 

The €2,500 fee is a bit much for us, but we can potentially make it work. For the 90-minute set, we could do 00:30-02:00 if that works.
Regarding accommodation, we can provide two hotel rooms at the Moxy Berlin. For travel, would €500 cover the costs, or do you have specific requirements?
Also, could you share technical rider details so our production team can review them?

Looking forward to making this work!

Best regards,
Stacey Summer

Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Best,

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

My name is Stacey Summer from Vibrancy Events.
We are organizing the Equinox Festival in Berlin and would like to book DJ Horizon for the main stage.

Here are the details:
Festival name: Equinox
Date: September 20, 2025
Location: Tempelhofer Feld, Berlin
Capacity: 3500
Stage time request: 22:30-00:30

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your quick response. 

The €2,500 fee is a bit much for us, but we can potentially make it work. For the 90-minute set, we could do 00:30-02:00 if that works.
Regarding accommodation, we can provide two hotel rooms at the Moxy Berlin. For travel, would €500 cover the costs, or do you have specific requirements?
Also, could you share technical rider details so our production team can review them?

Looking forward to making this work!

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Best,

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Hello Mike,

My name is Stacey Summer from Vibrancy Events.
We are organizing the Equinox Festival in Berlin and would like to book DJ Horizon for the main stage.

Here are the details:
Festival name: Equinox
Date: September 20, 2025
Location: Tempelhofer Feld, Berlin
Capacity: 3500
Stage time request: 22:30-00:30
Budget: €1,500

We've heard great things about DJ Horizon's recent sets and believe they would be a perfect fit for our crowd.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
Stacey Summer

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your quick response. 

The €2,500 fee is a bit much for us, but we can potentially make it work. For the 90-minute set, we could do 00:30-02:00 if that works.
Regarding accommodation, we can provide two hotel rooms at the Moxy Berlin. For travel, would €500 cover the costs, or do you have specific requirements?
Also, could you share technical rider details so our production team can review them?

Looking forward to making this work!

Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Best,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for sending these over. I've reviewed both documents and everything looks mostly good, but I have one question about the contract.

It mentions that we must provide a dedicated sound engineer for DJ Horizon's set. 
We have one festival sound engineer who handles all main stage performances. 
Would this be sufficient?

Apart from this, everything else is fine. I'll process the payment once we clarify this point.

Hi Mike,

Thanks for sending these over. I've reviewed both documents and everything looks mostly good, but I have one question about the contract.

It mentions that we must provide a dedicated sound engineer for DJ Horizon's set. 
We have one festival sound engineer who handles all main stage performances. 
Would this be sufficient?

Apart from this, everything else is fine. I'll process the payment once we clarify this point.

Best regards,

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Hello Mike,

My name is Stacey Summer from Vibrancy Events.
We are organizing the Equinox Festival in Berlin and would like to book DJ Horizon for the main stage.

Here are the details:
Festival name: Equinox
Date: September 20, 2025
Location: Tempelhofer Feld, Berlin
Capacity: 3500
Stage time request: 22:30-00:30
Budget: €1,500

We've heard great things about DJ Horizon's recent sets and believe they would be a perfect fit for our crowd.

Looking forward to your response!

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your quick response. 

The €2,500 fee is a bit much for us, but we can potentially make it work. For the 90-minute set, we could do 00:30-02:00 if that works.
Regarding accommodation, we can provide two hotel rooms at the Moxy Berlin. For travel, would €500 cover the costs, or do you have specific requirements?
Also, could you share technical rider details so our production team can review them?

Looking forward to making this work!

Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Best,

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Hello Mike,

My name is Stacey Summer from Vibrancy Events.
We are organizing the Equinox Festival in Berlin and would like to book DJ Horizon for the main stage.

Here are the details:
Festival name: Equinox
Date: September 20, 2025
Location: Tempelhofer Feld, Berlin
Capacity: 3500
Stage time request: 22:30-00:30
Budget: €1,500

We've heard great things about DJ Horizon's recent sets and believe they would be a perfect fit for our crowd.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
Stacey Summer

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your quick response. 

The €2,500 fee is a bit much for us, but we can potentially make it work. For the 90-minute set, we could do 00:30-02:00 if that works.
Regarding accommodation, we can provide two hotel rooms at the Moxy Berlin. For travel, would €500 cover the costs, or do you have specific requirements?
Also, could you share technical rider details so our production team can review them?

Looking forward to making this work!

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Best,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for sending these over. I've reviewed both documents and everything looks mostly good, but I have one question about the contract.

It mentions that we must provide a dedicated sound engineer for DJ Horizon's set. 
We have one festival sound engineer who handles all main stage performances. 
Would this be sufficient?

Apart from this, everything else is fine. I'll process the payment once we clarify this point.

Hi Mike,

Perfect, thank you.

I've attached the signed contract and proof of payment.
Also, is DJ Horizon available for a short (15-min) press interview via Zoom during the week before the festival? 
This would be part of our promotional activities.

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

To: Mike Muller <mike@stellarbookings.com>

Hello Mike,

My name is Stacey Summer from Vibrancy Events.
We are organizing the Equinox Festival in Berlin and would like to book DJ Horizon for the main stage.

Here are the details:
Festival name: Equinox
Date: September 20, 2025
Location: Tempelhofer Feld, Berlin
Capacity: 3500
Stage time request: 22:30-00:30
Budget: €1,500

We've heard great things about DJ Horizon's recent sets and believe they would be a perfect fit for our crowd.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
Stacey Summer

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your quick response. 

The €2,500 fee is a bit much for us, but we can potentially make it work. For the 90-minute set, we could do 00:30-02:00 if that works.
Regarding accommodation, we can provide two hotel rooms at the Moxy Berlin. For travel, would €500 cover the costs, or do you have specific requirements?
Also, could you share technical rider details so our production team can review them?

Looking forward to making this work!

Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Best,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for sending these over. I've reviewed both documents and everything looks mostly good, but I have one question about the contract.

It mentions that we must provide a dedicated sound engineer for DJ Horizon's set. 
We have one festival sound engineer who handles all main stage performances. 
Would this be sufficient?

Apart from this, everything else is fine. I'll process the payment once we clarify this point.

Hi Mike,

Perfect, thank you.

I've attached the signed contract and proof of payment.
Also, is DJ Horizon available for a short (15-min) press interview via Zoom during the week before the festival? 
This would be part of our promotional activities.

4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Hello Mike,

My name is Stacey Summer from Vibrancy Events.
We are organizing the Equinox Festival in Berlin and would like to book DJ Horizon for the main stage.

Here are the details:
Festival name: Equinox
Date: September 20, 2025
Location: Tempelhofer Feld, Berlin
Capacity: 3500
Stage time request: 22:30-00:30
Budget: €1,500

We've heard great things about DJ Horizon's recent sets and believe they would be a perfect fit for our crowd.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
Stacey Summer

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your quick response. 

The €2,500 fee is a bit much for us, but we can potentially make it work. For the 90-minute set, we could do 00:30-02:00 if that works.
Regarding accommodation, we can provide two hotel rooms at the Moxy Berlin. For travel, would €500 cover the costs, or do you have specific requirements?
Also, could you share technical rider details so our production team can review them?

Looking forward to making this work!

Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Best,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for sending these over. I've reviewed both documents and everything looks mostly good, but I have one question about the contract.

It mentions that we must provide a dedicated sound engineer for DJ Horizon's set. 
We have one festival sound engineer who handles all main stage performances. 
Would this be sufficient?

Apart from this, everything else is fine. I'll process the payment once we clarify this point.

Hi Mike,

Perfect, thank you.

I've attached the signed contract and proof of payment.
Also, is DJ Horizon available for a short (15-min) press interview via Zoom during the week before the festival? 
This would be part of our promotional activities.

Best regards,

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Hello Mike,

My name is Stacey Summer from Vibrancy Events.
We are organizing the Equinox Festival in Berlin and would like to book DJ Horizon for the main stage.

Here are the details:
Festival name: Equinox
Date: September 20, 2025
Location: Tempelhofer Feld, Berlin
Capacity: 3500
Stage time request: 22:30-00:30
Budget: €1,500

We've heard great things about DJ Horizon's recent sets and believe they would be a perfect fit for our crowd.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
Stacey Summer

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your quick response. 

The €2,500 fee is a bit much for us, but we can potentially make it work. For the 90-minute set, we could do 00:30-02:00 if that works.
Regarding accommodation, we can provide two hotel rooms at the Moxy Berlin. For travel, would €500 cover the costs, or do you have specific requirements?
Also, could you share technical rider details so our production team can review them?

Looking forward to making this work!

Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Best,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for sending these over. I've reviewed both documents and everything looks mostly good, but I have one question about the contract.

It mentions that we must provide a dedicated sound engineer for DJ Horizon's set. 
We have one festival sound engineer who handles all main stage performances. 
Would this be sufficient?

Apart from this, everything else is fine. I'll process the payment once we clarify this point.

Best regards,
Stacey Summer

Your festival sound engineer will be sufficient.

Hi Mike,

Perfect, thank you.

I've attached the signed contract and proof of payment.
Also, is DJ Horizon available for a short (15-min) press interview via Zoom during the week before the festival? 
This would be part of our promotional activities.

Best regards,

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

To: Mike Muller <mike@stellarbookings.com>

Hello Mike,

My name is Stacey Summer from Vibrancy Events.
We are organizing the Equinox Festival in Berlin and would like to book DJ Horizon for the main stage.

Here are the details:
Festival name: Equinox
Date: September 20, 2025
Location: Tempelhofer Feld, Berlin
Capacity: 3500
Stage time request: 22:30-00:30
Budget: €1,500

We've heard great things about DJ Horizon's recent sets and believe they would be a perfect fit for our crowd.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
Stacey Summer

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out.

The date looks available currently, but DJ Horizons standard fee for festivals of this size is €2,500 plus travel and accommodation for 2 people (the artist travels with their visual technician). 
They would require a minimum 90-minute set.

Let me know if these terms work for you.

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your quick response. 

The €2,500 fee is a bit much for us, but we can potentially make it work. For the 90-minute set, we could do 00:30-02:00 if that works.
Regarding accommodation, we can provide two hotel rooms at the Moxy Berlin. For travel, would €500 cover the costs, or do you have specific requirements?
Also, could you share technical rider details so our production team can review them?

Looking forward to making this work!

Hi Sarah,

After discussing with DJ Horizon, we can meet you halfway at €2,200 for the artist fee. The 00:30-02:00 slot works well.

Moxy Berlin is fine, please include late checkout. 
Regarding travel, we'll need €700 total as they'll be flying in from Amsterdam.

I've attached the technical rider.

Hi Mike,

Thanks for sending these over. I've reviewed both documents and everything looks mostly good, but I have one question about the contract.

It mentions that we must provide a dedicated sound engineer for DJ Horizon's set. 
We have one festival sound engineer who handles all main stage performances. 
Would this be sufficient?

Apart from this, everything else is fine. I'll process the payment once we clarify this point.

Hi Mike,

Perfect, thank you.

I've attached the signed contract and proof of payment.
Also, is DJ Horizon available for a short (15-min) press interview via Zoom during the week before the festival? 
This would be part of our promotional activities.

Best regards,

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.
