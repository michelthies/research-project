hey marcus,

im doing well, thanks.

this could work, however there are some things to point out.

the playtime is always 1 hour for dj eclipse and he travels +1 (1 hotelroom with a double bed is needed)

the artist fee is 1000+++

does that work for you?

hey marcus,

im doing well, thanks.

this could work, however there are some things to point out.

the playtime is always 1 hour for dj eclipse and he travels +1 (1 hotelroom with a double bed is needed)

the artist fee is 1000+++

does that work for you?
