Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.

Extract the relevant booking data from the message and return the updated booking object accordingly.
Your response must contain ONLY a valid JSON object.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, introductions, conclusions, prefix, suffix, or anything else.


I want you to reason through this step-by-step before providing your final answer.

First, analyze the email and identify all relevant information related to:
1. Artist details
2. Promoter details 
3. Event details
4. Booking details
5. Invoice details
6. Contract details

Then, compare this information with the previous data to identify:
- New information that should be added
- Existing information that should be updated
- Information missing in the email that should be preserved from previous data

Let me think through each step:

For dates and times:
- All dates must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
- All date-times must be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T00:00:00Z)
- I will convert any mentioned times to the proper format

For conflicting or missing information:
- When new information contradicts existing data, I will use the new information
- When information is not mentioned in the new email, I will preserve data from the previous extraction
- I will update status fields when mentioned (booking status, invoice status, contract status)

Before finalizing, I will verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. All values match the expected data types
3. All dates and times are in proper ISO format
4. All enum values (status fields) use allowed values

After completing this reasoning process, I will provide ONLY the final JSON object.
