## ACTION PROTOCOL
ANALYZE: Parse email content for booking-related information and updates

  - Convert numerical values appropriately (capacity and ticketPrice as numbers)

CONTEXTUALIZE:
  - PRESERVE existing data from previous extraction when not contradicted
  - UPDATE values explicitly mentioned in current email
  - RESOLVE conflicts by prioritizing most recent information
  - MAINTAIN relational integrity between entities

VERIFY:
  - Ensure all values match expected data types per schema
  - Verify enum values match ONLY allowed options in schema
  - Validate date and time formats to ISO standards
  - Set missing or invalid values to null rather than omitting them

CONSTRUCT:

  - Include all properties defined in the schema, using null for missing values
  - Ensure proper JSON syntax with quotes around keys and string values
  - Format numbers without quotes

ANALYZE: Parse email content for booking-related information and updates
IDENTIFY: Find all relevant entities in the email that match schema properties
EXTRACT: Pull out the associated values and context for each entity
TRANSFORM: 
  - Standardize dates to ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2025-11-25)
  - Standardize times to ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ (example: 2025-11-25T20:00:00Z)
  - Normalize status values to schema-compliant enumerations only
  - Convert numerical values appropriately (capacity and ticketPrice as numbers)

CONTEXTUALIZE:
  - PRESERVE existing data from previous extraction when not contradicted
  - UPDATE values explicitly mentioned in current email
  - RESOLVE conflicts by prioritizing most recent information
  - MAINTAIN relational integrity between entities

VERIFY:
  - Ensure all values match expected data types per schema
  - Verify enum values match ONLY allowed options in schema
  - Validate date and time formats to ISO standards
  - Set missing or invalid values to null rather than omitting them

CONSTRUCT:
  - Build JSON structure exactly according to schema specification

  - PRESERVE existing data from previous extraction when not contradicted
  - UPDATE values explicitly mentioned in current email
  - RESOLVE conflicts by prioritizing most recent information
  - MAINTAIN relational integrity between entities

VERIFY:
  - Ensure all values match expected data types per schema
  - Verify enum values match ONLY allowed options in schema
  - Validate date and time formats to ISO standards
  - Set missing or invalid values to null rather than omitting them

CONSTRUCT:
  - Build JSON structure exactly according to schema specification
  - Include all properties defined in the schema, using null for missing values
  - Ensure proper JSON syntax with quotes around keys and string values
  - Format numbers without quotes

==================== RESPONSE ====================

Here is the extracted booking data in JSON format:

{
"booking": {
"status": "confirmed",
"artist": {
"name": "DJ Meteor"
},
"promoter": {
"name": null,
"company": "Nova Entertainment",
"address": "Hammarby Slussväg 2"
},
"event": {
"date": "2022-08-06",
"name": "Stockholm",
"city": "Stockholm",
"venue": {
"name": "Cosmic Garden",
"address": "Hammarby Slussväg 2"
},
"capacity": 500,
"ticketPrice": null,
"openingTime": "17:00",
"closingTime": "03:00",
"stageTime": {
"start": null,
"end": null
}
},
"invoice": {
"amount": null,
"status": "paid"
},
"contract": {
"status": "signed"
}
}

Note that I've standardized the dates to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD), and the times to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ). I've also normalized the status values to schema-compliant enumerations only.
